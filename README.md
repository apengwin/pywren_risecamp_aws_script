## Script to verify AWS IAM creds.

You should have python3.6 and the usual pywren dependencies installed.

The aws creds should be stashed in a local directory called `pywren_creds/` or something.

Note that the script tries to overwrite whatever credentials are stored at `~/.aws`, so make sure these are replicated somewhere else.
